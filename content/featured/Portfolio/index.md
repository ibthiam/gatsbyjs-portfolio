I created this personal web space, based on the work of [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/), in order to illustrate my knowledge and my experience in the broad field of IT. While giving you an overview of my professional journey, so far at least.

This space also allows me to preserve the important notions: *“Memory does not film, memory photographs”*.

This site is designed with the open source **Gatsby** framework which is based on **React.js**.
