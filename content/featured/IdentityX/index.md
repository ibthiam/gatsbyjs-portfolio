**[Umnia Bank](https://www.umniabank.ma/fr/accueil)** recently enhanced its mobile banking application to facilitate remote account opening. This update includes a biometrics module allowing users to securely authenticate and provide proof of life during the registration process.

In collaboration with the Umnia teams, I contributed to the integration, testing and adjustment of the **[DAON](https://www.daon.com/)** SDKs (**Android** and **iOS**) as well as **[Regula](https://regulaforensics.com/)** (**OCR**), providing a complete solution for authentication biometrics and the ocerization of identity documents using the **[IdentityX](https://www.daon.com/products/identityx/)** authentication server in **JAVA**.
