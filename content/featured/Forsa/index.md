**[SMIT (Moroccan Society of Tourism Engineering)](https://smit.gov.ma)** has launched a financing program allowing young project leaders to benefit from financing, incubation and monitoring of their projects by the Moroccan State. The objective was to promote and support youth entrepreneurship in the country.

I participated, with the **[SMIT](https://smit.gov.ma)** teams, in the design & implementation (in **JAVA** and with **ODOO**) of the **[MechanismeFORSA](https://forsa.ma/)** module of **[MoovappsProcess](https://moovapps.com)** solution published by **[Visiativ](https://visiativ.com)**, which makes phase 4 (financing) of the support program for project leaders.
