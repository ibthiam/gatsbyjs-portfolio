**[SMIT (Moroccan Society of Tourist Engineering)](https://smit.gov.ma)** has launched a financing program allowing **Kasbah** owners, tourist operators and investors to benefit from the financial contribution of the Moroccan State. The objective is to promote and support tourism in the country.

I contributed to the design & implementation of the **[KasbahProgram](https://smit.gov.ma/nos-ami/)** module of the **[MoovappsProcess](https://moovapps.com)** solution in **JAVA**, in order to allow interested parties to launch their requests on the platform and for **[SMIT](https://smit.gov.ma)** to execute the various validation processes of these as well as to carry out a complete follow-up.
