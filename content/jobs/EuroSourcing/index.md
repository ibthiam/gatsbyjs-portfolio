- In this project, I had to Study & develop a Hybrid mobile application (in **[ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v4/components)**, **TypeScript** and **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**) named **WhereU**, allowing the generation, storage and sharing of a code based on the GPS positioning of a target on the map.
- Develop and integrate all the different modules, while including a **Spring/JAVA** back-end used to store and centralize some data.
