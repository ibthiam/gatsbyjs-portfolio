- In this project, I had to Study & develop a Hybrid mobile application (in **[ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v4/components)** and **[firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)**) named WhereU, allowing the generation, storage and sharing of a code based on the GPS positioning of a target on the map.
