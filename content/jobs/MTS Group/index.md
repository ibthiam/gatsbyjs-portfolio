- My objective was to implement the SHARE module of the **[AlfrescoECM](https://docs.alfresco.com/content-services/6.0/)** solution in the intranet of the company Togocel (newly **[Togocom](https://togocom.tg/)**), a telephone operator in Togo.
- Collect and analyze the functional needs and technical constraints of Togocom's business departments,
- Study versions 5.6 & 6 of the ECM/GEIDE solution and adapt version 6 to the customerâ€™s needs,
- Develop and integrate the SHARE module via REST APIs with Java, Spring, Swagger, etc.
- Launch functional and technical test batches.
