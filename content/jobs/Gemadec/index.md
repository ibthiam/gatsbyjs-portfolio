- One mission consisted of the design of a **React**, **[Python](https://docs.python.org/fr/3.8/)** and **Django** platform allowing the ocerization of Moroccan **ID card** (2008 and 2020 versions), **Residence permit** (2008 and 2020), **Passport** and **Driver's license**. The ocerization engine is based on **[EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR)** itself based on **[Tesseract_ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)** from Google.
- Another mission was to design and implement the **MechanismFORSA** module of the **[MoovappsProcess](https://moovapps.com)** solution published by **[Visiativ](https://visiativ.com)** in **Java/Spring**, which makes phase 4 of the **[FORSA](https://forsa.ma) state funding program possible. This program is run by **[SMIT(Moroccan Society of Tourism Engineering)](https://smit.gov.ma)** and allows the financing of young project leaders on a national scale.
