Our mission was to integrate the **[EHTCasExceptionnel](https://smit.gov.ma/nos-ami#eht)** module of the **[MoovappsProcess](https://moovapps.com)** solution to allow Kasbah owners to submit their requests with a view to benefiting from the State's financial contribution. At the same time, we have implemented the necessary functionalities so that **[SMIT](https://smit.gov.ma)** can validate these requests and ensure complete monitoring of the process.
