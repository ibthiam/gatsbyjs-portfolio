The main objective of this project was to develop a web application dedicated to the processing and sharing of commercial offers between agents of several call centers, notably **Optimum4U** in Mohammedia & Tangier, and **[Proximus](https://www.proximus.be/fr/personal/?)** in Brussels. 

This application, built with **React** for the front-end and **JAVA** for the back-end, offers an efficient platform for managing sales and transactions between geographically distributed teams.
