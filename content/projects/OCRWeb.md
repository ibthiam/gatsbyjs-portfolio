This mission consisted of the design of a **React**, **[Python](https://docs.python.org/fr/3.8/)** and **Django** platform allowing the ocerization of Moroccan **ID card** (2008 and 2020 versions), **Residence permit** (2008 and 2020), **Passport** and **Driver's license**. The ocerization engine is based on **[EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR)** itself based on **[Tesseract_ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)** from Google.
