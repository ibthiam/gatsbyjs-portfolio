**WhereU** is a hybrid mobile application with a commercial vocation which offers the possibility of generating, storing and sharing codes based on the geographical coordinates of a target.

It was developed with **[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/)** (Angular) and **Firebase** for the front-end, as well as **Spring/Java** for the back-end, to offer a smooth and secure cross-platform experience to users.
