This project aimed to deploy the SHARE module of the **[Alfresco](https://docs.alfresco.com/content-services/6.0/)** ECM solution in the intranet of Togocel (renamed **[Togocom](https://togocom.tg/)**), a telephone operator based in Togo. The addition of this module within the company's information system aimed to provide an efficient and fully indexed electronic archiving system, thereby improving the management and availability of data within the organization.
